<div class="main">I love the dissonant horn underneath the first ten seconds. At :10 BEP role player
and hidden gem apl.de.app slides in for his verse, featuring this now-hilarious line: "We don't use
dollars to represent/We just use our inner sense and talent." Whatever, dudes, enjoy your giant
piles of sellout cash! The rarr sounds and "Alligator" lead in from :30-:34 are inspired whimsy.
Where have you gone, B.E.P....

<div class="main">Nirvana knew when to be loud and when to be soft, and Dave Grohl's post-Cobain
career shows that he deserves some of the praise for that. This song mopes along for three minutes
and then lurches through a  crescendo during this snippet to finish the song among typically
crashing guitars. It's not incredible song-smithery; sort of the music equivalent of throwing some
more salt onto your bland dinner, but it's effective here. I wouldn't say that Grohl is a musical
genius, but he's a complete professional with an eye for a hook and composition that's led to a
long career. Good for him.

<div class="main">Not much to say here: acoustic anti-war guitar noodling, and an objective lesson
that you don't need distortion and effects to create a great solo. This song was an inspiration
for learning to play the guitar. Note that the lead is exclusively on the left and the rhythm almost
exclusively on the right, so you can play with your stereo settings to hear one or the other more
closely.

<div class="main">I'm a sucker for creative recording techniques. Sample yourself over and over;
cut and paste with some unknown drops at the end of your two minute intro? I'm down. I usually find
scratching tiresome, but in this instance it adds to the collage feel of this snippet. What is
still totally bogus, by the by, is mixing together snippets of famous songs and selling the work as
your own. Girl Talk: the world's first touring recording engineer. Maybe he can be on a double bill
with like Hi-Tek, who can just press play on the <i>Black Star</i> album and call it a concert. Get
your tickets early!

The interesting thing about this snippet are the metallic effects you can hear on the far right of
the mix. They sound like overdriven distorted pick sounds, but they're in rhythm with the lead
guitar, which is on the left side of the mix. It makes me wonder whether Metallica added extra
chunky pick noises with another guitar on a separate track, which would be neat. See if you can
decipher it...it's strongest right away.
