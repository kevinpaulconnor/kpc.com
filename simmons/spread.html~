"Spread Operator" and "Spread" work together. Enter positive numbers in "Spread"
to see how Simmons does picking the underdog, negative numbers to see how he does
picking the favorite, and 0 to see how he does when the game is a PK. Note that 
you must select an option from "Spread Operator" to activate the "Spread" text 
box and vice versa. I.E., setting "Spread Operator" to "less than" and "Spread" 
to "-5" will return Simmons results for picking teams favored by more than five 
points, but leaving "Spread Operator" to "Any" or "Spread" blank will have no effect.
